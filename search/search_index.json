As we will see throughout the documentation, LLMs can be incorporated into software in a wide variety of ways. Some ways of incorporating LLMs into programs tend to result in robust and performant systems, while others result in software that is brittle and error-prone.</p> <p>Generative programs are distinguished from classical programs by their use of functions that invoke generative models. These generative calls can produce many different data types \u2014 strings, booleans, structured data, code, images/video, and so on. The model(s) and software underlying generative calls can be combined and composed in certain situations and in certain ways (e.g., LoRA adapters as a special case). In addition to invoking generative calls, generative programs can invoke other functions, written in languages that do not have an LLM in their base, so that we can, for example, pass the output of a generative function into a DB retrieval system and feed the output of that into another generator. Writing generative programs is difficult because generative programs interleave deterministic and stochastic operations.</p> <p>If you would like to read more about this, please don't hesitate to take a look here.</p>"},{"location":"lab_01/readme/#mellea","title":"Mellea","text":"<p>Mellea is a library for writing generative programs.
