## Introduction

Welcome to our workshop! In this workshop we'll be using the open-sourced [IBM Granite
AI foundation models](https://www.ibm.com/granite) and [Mellea](https://github.com/generative-computing/mellea) for a number of use cases that demonstrates the value of [generative AI](https://developer.ibm.com/generative-ai-for-developers).

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

* Run a simple "Hello Mellea" program
* Use Mellea to Instruct, Validate, Repair
* Have some fun with `@generative` functions
* Use Mellea and [Docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling)
* ...
